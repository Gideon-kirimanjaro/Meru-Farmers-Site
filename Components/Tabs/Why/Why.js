        We use macadamia nuts that have been grown ethically by smallholder
        farmers. The Kenya Board of Safety Standards ensures our nuts are of
        high quality because they are picked and cleaned right after they are
        picked. Sourcing, quality analysis, drying, grading, cracking, shell
        separation, sorting, grading, vacuum packaging, cartoning, and exporting
        are all processes in the production process. We have a food safety
        policy and quality guidelines for our employees and farmers. We also
        have cleaning, sanitation, and environmental monitoring systems in
        place, standard operating procedures, and
