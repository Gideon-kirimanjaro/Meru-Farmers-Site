        We specialize in providing excellent halal-quality macadamia nuts that
        humans have skillfully hand-processed with love and care. Sun drying,
        sorting, and packaging are manual methods used to process nuts. Once the
        nuts have been vacuum packed, they are dosed with nitrogen, sealed, and
        then cartoned in 25 pounds of food-grade aluminum before being
        refrigerated to 12â€“14 degrees Celsius.
